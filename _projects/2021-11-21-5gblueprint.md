    5G Blue-print aims to design and implement a 5G network for CAM (Connected and Automated Mobility) services with stringent requirements on latency, handover time, reliability, packet loss, and throughput. Secondly, tailor and implement the prototype of a teleoperated system. Thirdly, implement and deploy enabling functions guaranteeing the safety of teleoperated transport. And finally validate the end-to-end teleoperated transport solution supported by 5G in real-life scenarios in cross-border conditions.
