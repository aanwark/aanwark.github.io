    The SmartWaterWay project aimed to make autonomous shipping using pallet shuttle barges profitable for logistics companies. It enabled low-cost alternatives for communication, positioning and sensing to cut automation costs to EUR 100,000 or less. Additional data from sensing and localization infrastructure at key waterway locations – combined with remote monitoring of 4-5 unmanned cargo vessels by a single captain – enabled simpler navigation, decrease in the costs of infrastructure sensors and unlocked significant cost savings by eliminating the need for crew.
