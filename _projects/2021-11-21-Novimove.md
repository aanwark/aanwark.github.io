    Novimove aims to solve three main problems: <br />
    1. A density problem: the entire logistics system needs to be compressed, meaning higher load factors, less time in port, shorter waiting times at bridges and locks, optimal navigation on rivers; <br />
    2. A data fusion problem: data collection, access to data sources, data perception and data analysis must be significantly improved to support a more dense logistics system; <br />
    3. A plan and control problem: effective management of cargo flows, vessels, port terminals and waterways infrastructures for a compressed logistics system depends on data and information qualities that are not sufficiently available yet. <br />
    The main contributions of Novimove are: <br />
    1. Improved load factor of containers by means of cargo reconstruction; <br />
    2. Improved port logistics by reducing waiting times at terminals and sailing time between terminals; <br />
    3. Improved river navigation by satellite, sensor and data fusion; <br />
    4. Reduced waiting time at bridges and locks by dynamic scheduling system; <br />
    5. Innovative vessel solutions to cope with variable water levels; <br />
    6. New business models in current stakeholdersâ€™ networks.
