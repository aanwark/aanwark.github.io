abstract: |
    De Blauwe Cluster ICON Shared Situational Awareness for Vessels (SSAVE) revolved around enabling vessel to vessel communication for the sake of creating the real-time digital twin of the vessel surrounding in port and inland scenarios. The research was carried out for the creation of a middleware communication framework which bootstrapped real-time peer to peer communication via Kafka brokers. The goal was to demonstrate this communication at the granularity of sensors and using it for detecting objects via distributed sensor fusion. The analysis on tha data quality of sensor streams was provided along with real-time telemetery of the state of the communication.
